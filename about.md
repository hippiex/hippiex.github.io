Programming
---------------
I have been programming since I was six in BASIC on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_VIC-20">Commodore VIC-20</a> with it's fancy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_Datasette">cassette tape drive</a>. Then I moved on to an Apple IIc and Apple Pascal for a time.  In college I continued on with Pascal and ADA for a time. I started with Coldfusion to create sites for the furniture and textile manufacturing industries. I have a worked with Microsft SQL server, Oracle, and MYSQL for my entire career.

Dog
---------------
Zoe is my 3 year old Australian Cattle dog mix who excels in jumping over/on things she should not, swimming, and moral support for solving difficult programming problems.

Gaming
---------------
When I was younger I used to be fairly good at Street Fighter 2+, but my skills have deteriorated with age unfortunately. I traveled Azeroth for a time and currently check out games of DOTA2 and League of Legends when I get bored.
