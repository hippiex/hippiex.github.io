I always need to do `JOINED` updates in `MySql` amd the documentation on their site doesn't help a whole lot. Then I always forget what the exact phrase to google for. (Joined updates, multi-table updates, updating from one table to another, etc..)  I found some great examples over on `The Electric Toolbox` that makes it dead simple.

So I am posting it here as a reminder and for anyone else wondering how to do it.
