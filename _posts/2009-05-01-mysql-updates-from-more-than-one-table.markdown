I can never seem to remember the MySQL syntax for JOINED updates when I need them and the MySQL documentation on their site doesn't help a whole lot. Then I always forget what the exact phase to google for. (Joined updates, multi-table updates, updating from one table to another, etc..)  I found some great examples over on `The Electric Toolbox` that makes it dead simple.
So I am posting it here as a reminder later on, and in case someone else was wondering how to do it and couldn't find it.
