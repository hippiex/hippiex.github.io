Oddly one my iMac I had no issues with installing Jekyll, but on my Macbook Air it would error trying to install to /usr/bin/.  I did update the gem installer which may have caused the issues.  So I am noting this here for my future reference and including the link to the solution.

Updated gems.

{% highlight  js %}
sudo gem update --system
{% endhighlight %}

Install jekyll to /usr/local/bin

{% highlight  js %}
sudo gem install -n /usr/local/bin jekyll
{% endhighlight %}

There are also Hombrew install instructions, but I really wanted to to work with my normal OS X install since I don't use Ruby for anything, but Jekyll at the moment.
